This research presents a comprehensive framework for the automated detection of fruit diseases in economically important fruits, such as mango, guava, citrus, and pomegranate. Using a dataset of 30,260 images, we evaluated the performance of six models: Custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ResNet-50, VGG-16, MobileNet-V3, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The Custom CNN outperformed others with 99% accuracy, highlighting the superiority of deep learning in complex disease recognition. Our study contributes to sustainable agriculture by providing an efficient and scalable solution for early disease detection, improving crop health and productivity while reducing the reliance on agrochemicals.
